_DESCRIPTION = """
This dataset consists of images generated by running the PerfectAsciiConverter (with a C64 character set)
on a series of color images. The source images were preprocessed by first converting them to high contrast
black and white images with the Otsu filter run on each 8x8 block of the image, and subsequently fed to the
ASCII converter, which matched each of these blocks to the closest C64 character available in the character set.

Each text file is a tab delimited CSV which is the result of running this process over one source image. Each line
in the file represents one training example, or one processed 8x8 binary block of the source image. The first column 
represents the label (ID of the character chosen for this particular block), and columns 2-65 the binary pixel data
of the source image in 0-1 range.

This derived dataset omits a list of characters from the original dataset, which showed very low frequency
